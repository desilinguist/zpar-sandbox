Purpose

The purpose of this memorandum is to explain the process within the enterprise risk management framework that would be followed in aligning our risk appetite and strategy.

Process

Based on our risk assessment we will consider the following risks:

- Inherent Risk
- Business Risk
- Market Risk


Inherent risk : We have risks inherent in our operations, our strategy will identify process and will enhance the weaknesses in the process by setting appropriate controls

Business risk: The environment in which we operate includes multi-locations around the world, therefore we need to evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and hedge them as appropriate

Market Risk: Fluctuations in the market may impact our capacity to access financial resources required for our capital


The purpose of this memorandum is to explain the process within the enterprise risk framework that will help Airtight Co. align its risk appetite and its risk tolerance.

It is necessary for our management to analyze the current financial state we are in.  Issues such as the amount and type of assets, as well as the amount and type of liabilities will affect the risks our company is willing to take.  After analyzing the financial state, the management should have a better idea of what type of risks the company can take.

Our first priority is to maximize value for our shareholders, so it is wise to use risk-averse behavior.  Risk-averse behavior results in investments that have either a low probability of occurring with a high impact, a high probability of occurring with a low impact, or a low probability of occurring with a low impact.  Following this philosophy will result in a low chance of losing money of risky investments, and will do nothing but help maximize shareholder value for our shareholders.

Please let me know if you have any follow up questions.
